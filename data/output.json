As a nonbinary trans person who has worked with my own voice on gender-related goals, I have engaged in many different trainings to explore how music and singing can be used as resources for accessing and embodying various speech and singing patterns. My approach is very holistic and collaborative. Instead of prescribing a \"feminine,\" \"masculine,\" or \"androgynous\" voice, I support individuals with exploring different qualities of sound that most resonate with them and help them bring those qualities into their own voice. I am also a licensed counselor and hold as much space as is needed for the emotional process within any vocal training. I believe that when we are working with the voice, we are also working with any emotional content / trauma that lies in the body. My approach is informed by my experience and training as a music therapist, licensed counselor, singer/songwriter, and voice teacher. Additionally, I train other music therapists in how to facilitate gender affirming voicework.",

I provide guidance about what kinds of vocal qualities are likely to be present based on a students' gender expression goals, while also being mindful of the huge diversity of voices that occur independent from gender expression.

I have experience working with GAV training for pre-teens and adults as well as pre- and post-op voice care for gender-affirming voice surgeries. Before I was an SLP, I was a professor of voice who often worked with gender-diverse singers at Berklee College of Music. \nI have also been fortunate to study via workshops and courses with amazing gender-affirming voice trainers like Sandy HIrsch, AC Goldberg, Leah Helou, Christie Block, Ruchi Kapila, and others. But the biggest source of my learning has been and will always be my clients/patients. I have learned so much through what works (and sometimes what doesn\u2019t work!) with the gender-diverse speakers and singers who have worked together with me to hone their vocal \u201ctoolbox\u201d and develop a voice that fits who they are. I am a lifelong learner, and I am committed to always seeking out opportunities for learning so I can continue to empower people to find the tools for their own unique voice. ",

I was a professor of voice at Berklee College of Music for almost a decade and can teach all styles - from classical to pop/rock to jazz.

I also work to provide GAV training in collaboration with our wonderful pediatric physician colleagues in primary care, psychology, endocrinology and other disciplines for gender-diverse pediatric and preteen patients through the Compass Program at Weill Cornell Medicine. \nI am also active as a researcher, with my main area of focus being the effects of sex hormones on the voice, and our team is active in advancing technology to improve gender-affirming voice care access.

We have regular meetings among our gender-affirming voice care staff to continue to improve our practices so that everyone who comes into our office feels welcomed and safe. No one is perfect, but I always try to learn from my mistakes and move forward in a way that is productive and doesn\u2019t put the burden on my patient or client. ",

            "cultural": "As a doctor specializing in voice care, I can provide some insights into the impact and importance of voice therapy for voice feminization:\nThere is no single \"correct\" feminine voice. The aim is to help each individual find a voice that feels authentic to their identity and allows them to communicate comfortably in their daily lives. This requires a culturally humble approach that recognizes the diversity of gender expressions across different backgrounds and communities.\nWhen I first meet patients, my speech pathologist Lex and I see them within our voice center and discuss their concerns as a team \u2013 with the patient as the most important member. We listen carefully to understand their unique goals and experiences, acknowledging that each person's journey is shaped by their cultural context and individual circumstances.\nVoice therapy is a crucial component of gender-affirming care. It helps patients develop a voice that aligns with their gender identity by working on pitch, resonance, intonation, articulation, and non-verbal communication skills. Aligning these aspects can significantly improve quality of life and self-expression.\nFor some patients, voice therapy alone may not achieve the desired results. In these cases, we may consider voice feminization surgery as an adjunct treatment. However, surgery is typically only recommended after a course of voice therapy, as it's crucial to develop healthy vocal techniques regardless of pitch. These techniques carry over after voice surgery and allow the voice to represent one's true self.\nA patient-centered, culturally sensitive approach is key to successful outcomes in transgender voice care. This involves respecting each individual's unique background, values, and goals throughout the process. We strive to create a safe and inclusive environment where patients feel empowered to explore and express their authentic selves through their voice.\n",
