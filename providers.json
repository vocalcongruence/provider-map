My approach is very holistic and collaborative. Instead of prescribing a \"feminine,\" \"masculine,\" or \"androgynous\" voice, I support individuals with exploring different qualities of sound that most resonate with them and help them bring those qualities into their own voice. I am also a licensed counselor and hold as much space as is needed for the emotional process within any vocal training. I believe that when we are working with the voice, we are also working with any emotional content / trauma that lies in the body. My approach is informed by my experience and training as a music therapist, licensed counselor, singer/songwriter, and voice teacher.

I provide guidance about what kinds of vocal qualities are likely to be present based on a students' gender expression goals, while also being mindful of the huge diversity of voices that occur independent from gender expression.
